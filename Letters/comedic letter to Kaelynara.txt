Kaelynara,

It is with some regret that I must inform you that I am relieving you of your duties ans my apprentice. I blame myself for being mistaken of your potential; I hope you can understand that even the most talented of mages sometimes make mistakes. At least now you can put your ineptitude behind you and pursue a reasonable goal. Perhaps basket weaving may prove more suitable for your... talents.
	
Unfortunately I do not associate myself with any baskey weavers specifically and am too busy to write you a recommendation. Please return to Tempestas at your soonest convenience.

- Astalor
