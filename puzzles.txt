A long corridor, at the end of which are illusionary bars, with an illusionary (fill in creature that is too tough for the players to handle) behind the bars. Right in front of the bars is a teleporter that teleports only size T or smaller items to behind the PCs. In between the two teleporters is a numbing zone, where pain cannotbe felt. If the PCs are smart (and standard players), they will shoot arrows at the monster. Given enough time, they will kill themselves.

Best trap I ever saw was built into the side of an active volcano. The room had a natural corridor leading into it (no door!). There was a door at the far end. Depending on how good a mood you're in the room can have nothing in it, fixed furnishings, or mobile furnishings.The trick is that the door leads into the volcano shaft ABOVE the lava pool.Since heat rises, the air in the volcano is constantly moving upward. Opening the door, creates a very high vacuum towards the door sweeping a character into the lava pool unless they can react quickly with an appropriate spell or potion or grab onto a handhold.The best part of this trap is it is based on natural phenomena and therefore really isn't a trap -so it doesn't show up with detect trap magic.
