        <h2 id="QuestIsland">Quest Island</h2>
        <p>This 'island' (which technically isn't an island, but rather a peninsula) was named quest island long ago when a man named <a href="../characters/Dessa.html#BhomianDessa">Bhomian Dessa</a> set out on a quest to settle a new town with his family. He traveled down Quey river heading north where he eventually founded Dessaquest. This island is home to a small settlement of wild <a href="https://dnd-5e-homebrew.tumblr.com/post/144603162549/murloc-race-by-maclimes">Murlocs</a> (<a href="https://www.pirategonzalezgames.com/piratesblog/2019/7/20/murlocs">character sheets</a>). These murlocs tend to wonder about at night and tend to stay hidden throughout the daylight hours. They have a small village in the center of the island where they have their huts.</p>
        <h2 id="kennethZudLabQueyIsland">The Forgotten Lab of Kenneth Zud</h2>
        <p>Just north of Quest Island, under the shore, lies a small cave. The cave leads to an underground cavern only accessible by the water. This cavern is an abandoned laboratory of <a href="../characters/KennethZud.html">Kenneth Zud</a>. This cave is littered with old scraps and supplies. Upon investigation the party can find hte following items.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bone and feather quill</li>
            <li>bone kitchen utensils and tools</li>
            <li>Wooden bowls</li>
            <li>Some old reading material</li>
            <li>Three un-marked vials of liquid (randomly chosen)</li>
            <li>A torn page from a book.</li>
            <li>A bent copper coin</li>
            <li>Some science and archeology notes</li>
            <li>A small mallet</li>
            <li>An intact basilisk spine</li>
            <li>A leatherworking pattern of how to make "Gloves of the GreatFather"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Two prominent features of this cave are a large Dragon egg (<a href="../items/eggOfEquestador.html">The Egg of Equestador</a> sitting atop a pedestal covered in thick fur hides in the center of the cavern with inscriptions (Written in Elvish) on it that explain how to hatch the egg and a marking on a stone on the wall that depicts a crystal dagger. Behind the dagger marking, within the stone lies one of the Loredmeyer daggers, detemined by 1d4.</p>
        <p>The Elvan tablet reads "The Egg of Equestador; This creature is my pride and joy. If I am lost to it, please be sure to provide care and protection to it as it matures. It requires warmth and darkness, and of course, love. -Kenneth Zud".</p>
