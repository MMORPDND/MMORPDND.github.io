    <p>This 'island' (which technically isn't an island, but rather a peninsula) was named quest island long ago when a man named <a href="../characters/Dessa.html#BhomianDessa">Bhomian Dessa</a> set out on a quest to settle a new town with his family. He traveled down Quey river heading north where he eventually founded Dessaquest. This island is home to a small settlement of wild <a href="https://dnd-5e-homebrew.tumblr.com/post/144603162549/murloc-race-by-maclimes">Murlocs</a> (<a href="https://www.pirategonzalezgames.com/piratesblog/2019/7/20/murlocs">character sheets</a>). These murlocs tend to wonder about at night and tend to stay hidden throughout the daylight hours. They have a small village in the center of the island where they have their huts.</p>
