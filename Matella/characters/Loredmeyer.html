        <h1>The LoredMeyer Pair</h1>
        <p>At a young age, a dark warlock kidnapped two sets of twins, around the same age. The first set, Pellinore and Essieldore (male), and the second, Elaine and Azshira (female). The warlock did so in order to grow the four souls needed for his imbued weapons he was creating for four elite Hassasin warriors of the Zelhu Empire (by orders of the emperor himself). The the magic to be at its most potent, the bond of love and loyalty was needed between the souls. For this reason, twins were chosen, both a male and female set. Isolated from the rest of civilization, these sets of twins were raised in the central mountains of Sateda. Upon coming of age, each twin, as desired took one of the opposing twins as spouse, creating the LoredMeyer pairs. To their misfortune, the souls of both of these pairs were stripped from their bodies and used to imbue the magical essence of their being into four magical weapons, <a href="../items/fangOfPellinore.html">The Fang Of Pellinore</a>, <a href="../items/fangOfElaine.html">The Fang Of Elaine</a>, <a href="../items/fangOfAzshira.html">The Fang Of Azshira</a>, and <a href="../items/fangOfEssieldore.html">The Fang Of Essieldore</a></p>.
