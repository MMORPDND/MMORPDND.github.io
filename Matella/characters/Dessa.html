    <p>Bhomian Dessa is the original founder of the <a href="../towns/dessaquest.html">Dessaquest</a> town. He traveled north from his previous home with his family in hopes to found his own town with his family. He traveled north via Quey river, where he is known to have mistakenly name a peninsula <a href="../rivers/queyRiver.html#QuestIsland">Quest Island</a>, while sailing past it. The name ended up sticking via family tradition. To this day, there are still descendants of the Dessa family living in Dessaquest. They primarily run the farms and provide much of what the town has to trade with other towns. The last name has changed iterations over time and went from Dessa, to Dessal, and finally landing at Dessala with the current day descendants. Current day living descendants are Tonya Dessala, Bren Dessala (Married to Tonya), and Gilb Dessalla.</p>
